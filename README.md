## Concern of Security in Data Layer

- Data Collection (Dynamic Phase)
  - **Description:** Data is gathered from various sourcesâ€”APIs, sensors, web scraping, user input, etc.
  - **Risks:**
      - **Data Poisoning Attacks:** Attackers inject manipulated or biased data during collection.
      - **Data Fetching Attacks:** Malicious code or hijacked data streams compromise the incoming data in real time.
