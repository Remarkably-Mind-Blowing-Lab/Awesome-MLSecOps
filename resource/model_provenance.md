# Model Provenance

- [Data Isotopes for Data Provenance in DNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13893), Proposes a method called "data isotopes" that enables users to detect whether their data was used to train deep neural networks (DNNs), enhancing data provenance tracking.
- [Vamsa: Automated Provenance Tracking in Data Science Scripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01861), Introduces the Vamsa system, which automatically extracts data provenance information from Python scripts without requiring modifications to the user's code.
- [Model Share AI: An Integrated Toolkit for Collaborative Machine Learning Model Development, Provenance Tracking, and Deployment in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15719), Describes an MLOps platform that facilitates collaborative model development, provenance tracking, and deployment.
- [Model Provenance via Model DNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02121), Proposes the concept of Model DNA, encoding training data and input-output relationships to track the provenance of pre-trained models.
- [Provenance-based Explanations for Machine Learning (ML) Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148106), Introduces a technique that captures data lineage information during model training to explain machine learning model decisions.
