# Model Provenance

- [Model Provenance via Model DNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02121), Proposes the concept of Model DNA, encoding training data and input-output relationships to track the provenance of pre-trained models.
- [Provenance-based Explanations for Machine Learning (ML) Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148106), Introduces a technique that captures data lineage information during model training to explain machine learning model decisions.
- [The Open Provenance Model](https://openprovenance.org/opm/), A framework designed to share process lineage information across systems, improving interoperability in provenance tracking.
